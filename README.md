# cve-2021-22205-hash-generator

Finds an identifiable hash value for each version of GitLab vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cves/-/blob/master/2021/CVE-2021-22205.json).

#### Running The Tool

###### Prerequisites

This tool requires that [docker be installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) along with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on the machine executing the binary.  It also requires connection to a mongodb instance of your choice.

#### Usage

* Download the latest binary release [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/gl-redteam/red-team-research/cve-2021-22205-hash-generator/-/releases), optionally along with the .env file.
* Change the password in the docker-compose.yml file.
* Edit the `.env` file in the root of this repository and set the environment variable "MONGODB_URI" to an appropriate connection string.  Example:  `MONGODB_URI="mongodb://root:<MY_SECURE_PASSWORD>@localhost:27017/"`.  Alternatively, you can simply export/set this variable directly from a terminal and not use the .env file.
* Run: `docker-compose up -d` to launch the mongodb instance and mongo express viewer.
* Launch the mongo express viewer if you like at:  http://localhost:8081/
* Run the tool with `./cve-2021-22205-hash-generator-<release>` making sure the executable is in the same directory as your .env file if you're using it.
